The weight for each group is computed using an exponential time-decay on signal count (30 day half-life) and a weighted sum based on the signal type. Use the 'signalTypeWeights' parameter to set the correct signal types and weights for your dataset. The results of this job can be used to boost documents at query time using the boosting stage.",
